    "Before writing any code in Python, you must create a controlled *environment* in which you will install the various packages, libraries, and tools necessary for your projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conda** is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. With it, you can easily create, save, load and switch between environments on your local computer, or in a cloud-based system. It supports mostly Python, but currently other languages as well (e.g. R).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment ([source](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/))."

    "# Anaconda IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Conda, you first have to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). There are many versions, but we will work with the individual, open-source version, which you can download for free:\n",
    " - *The open-source Individual Edition (Distribution) is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on a single machine. Developed for solo practitioners, it is the toolkit that equips you to work with thousands of open-source packages and libraries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Anaconda IDE [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda can be installed in any modern operating system (MS Windows, Linux, iOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the application, you have two options to start using it:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Command line (my personal favorite ðŸ˜ƒ): This option is the least user-friendly for using Conda. It requires experience using either the command-line (Windows), or terminal (Linux, macOS) applications. \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Anaconda-Navigator GUI: This option lets you use Conda in a web-like interface without having to enter manual commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever you use, the result will be the same. For convenience, you may proceed with the second option, however if you want to try the first one you are welcome to! In any case, I will always be here to help you with both, so don't worry! Below, I give detailed explanation of how to start working with Anaconda using either option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Command line / Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your operating system, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Windows: From the Start menu, search for and open \"Anaconda Prompt\". \n",
    "    <img src=\"images/Anaconda-prompt-Windows.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    " - Linux/macOS: Open a Terminal window\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/Terminal.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands are the same on either case:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Verify that Conda is installed and running on your system:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     conda --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    " 2. Update Conda to the current version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     conda update conda\n",
    "     ```\n",
    " 3. Managing environments: This is the most important part! Conda allows you to create separate environments containing files, packages, and their dependencies that will not interact with other environments. In that case, if things go south, you can always create a new, clean environment and work from there. The default environment is *base*.\n",
    "     - Create a new environment named \"new_env\" using a specific Python version (e.g. 3.8) and install a package in it (e.g. BioPython):\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         conda env create --name new_env python=3.8 biopython\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "     - Activate your new environment:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         conda activate new_env\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "     - Verify the Python version:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         python --version\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "     - To install new packages/libraries, you have two main options:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         conda install <package_name>\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         or\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         pip install <package_name>\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "     - You can open Jupyter notebook simply by typing:\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         jupyter-notebook\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list of all important Conda manual commands, you can always use [this cheatsheet](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose Option 2, then after installing Anaconda search for the *Anaconda-Navigator* application and start it:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Anaconda-Navigator.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<!---![Anaconda-Navigator](images/Anaconda-Navigator.png)--->\n",
    "\n",
    "*The interface is the same, regardless of your operating system.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This window contains a collection of Python tools, though most of them you will never have to use. The one that we are really interested in is the *Jupyter notebook*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Jupyter-notebook.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    "<!---![Jupyter](images/Jupyter-notebook.png)--->\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then press *Launch*. A command line window will appear and then a tab on your default web browser, which will point to a default directory (*e.g. Home directory on iOS*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, however, activating Jupyter, you should create a new environment that you will be working from. If you see carefully, the Navigator is set on the default *base* environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Anaconda-base.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left, you will see an option \"Environments\". Choose this option to see all the installed environments in your system besides *base* (if any), the packages already installed in every environment, as well as to create a new environment from scratch. You can also augment any existing Conda environment with new packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Anaconda-environments.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to create a new environment, a pop-up window will appear. There, you can define the name of the environment, and the Python version (ignore option for *R*). Press *Create* to create the new environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
